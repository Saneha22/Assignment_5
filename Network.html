            <p>Networks enable users to share files with others.</p>

                <b>To reduce cost of data transfer :</b>
            </li>
            <p>The cost of transfer of documents using computers connected on networks is cheaper than other conventional means like telegrams.</p>
            <li>
                <b> Verify data transfers :</b>
            </li>
            <p>Fluctuations of prices in foreign exchange and shares can be communicated instanataneously using the medium of computer communications.</p>

                <b>High reliability :</b>
            </li>
            <p>All files could be replicated on two or three machines, so if one of them is unavailable, the other copies could be  used </p>
